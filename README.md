# 🧠 Clustering Handwritten Digits with K-Means & PCA

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques using clustering algorithms on handwritten digit images. The focus is on implementing K-Means from scratch, enhancing it with K-Means++ initialization, and incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Implement K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy.
- Improve clustering efficiency and performance using K-Means++ initialization.
- Apply PCA to reduce high-dimensional image features while preserving data variance.
- Analyze cluster distribution and alignment with actual digit labels for validation.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Provided handwritten digit image dataset (`test.txt`)
- **Features:** Pixel intensities of grayscale digit images
- **Target (used only for validation):** True digit labels (not used during clustering)

## 📈 Results

- Successfully clustered digit images into 10 groups using K-Means.
- Achieved better centroid initialization and convergence with K-Means++.
- Visualized clusters and principal components to interpret results.
- Demonstrated unsupervised learning's potential even without label information.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- In-depth understanding of K-Means and its mathematical foundations.
- Practical experience with PCA and high-dimensional data visualization.
- Improved coding skills through implementing algorithms from scratch.
